# Project 2

#### For Project 2, we used JCup to implement a parser for the programming language Tiger. We did this by first creating terminals and non-terminals to use for our grammar. We started with Exp as our first non-terminal to parse through expressions and other terminals and non-terminals to parse symbols, funtions, and key words. We were having issues with our typedec and funcdec non-terminals. When compiling our code we had an output that would return a syntax error in the tiger code we would run. We also have a shift-reduce conflict in our if expression that needs resolving.
