#Project 3

### For Project 3, we used Java to implement a type checker and declaration processor into our copmiler. The type checher type-checks an abstract syntax tree and prints an error about mismatching types or undeclared identifiers if neeeded. This is done by having differnt ExpTy functions that check for differnt expression types in the Tiger code (test cases). If there are no errors, then the type checker goes through and prints the type of expression that is detected.
